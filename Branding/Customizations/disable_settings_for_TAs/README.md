Customizing the Top Menu with JavaScript 
======

This script describes how you would change the text in the email box on the Canvas
Login page.  By default, the text in the box is "Email" but this script will allow you
to change this.  

To use this script, include it in your global javascript file.  See
http://guides.instructure.com/s/2204/m/4214/l/41896-how-do-i-brand-my-canvas-instance to
learn more about this file.

When implementing this script, replace `<replacement>` with the text you want to appear.
For example, you may want to have that text be "A-Number" rather than "email".  


Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
