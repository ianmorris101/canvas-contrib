Enabling MathJax
======


This script will enable MatchJax (http://www.mathjax.org/) which you can use to
insert LaTex math formulas into the page.  Yes, Canvas has a built-in equation
editor but it doesn't support all LaTex markup or multiple lines.  

When MathJax is enabled on your account, you can insert LaTex markup anywhere
you can edit text.   The LaTex should be surrounded by one of two delimiters--
either \[ and \] or $$ and $$.

Both of the following lines do the same thing:

  \[ \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right) \]

  $$ \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right) $$


Note: You can insert a MathJax formula in a quiz question and it works. It also appears
that you can insert a formula in a quiz answer and it will work the first time
through. However, if you make any change to the question the formulas will get
mangled.

While you do not have to be in the source view to insert a formula, you will want
to verify that the formula is not enclosed by "&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;" tags.
These tags block MathJax from working properly.



Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.  That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
