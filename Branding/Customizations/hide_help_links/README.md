Hide Default Canvas Help Links
=================================

Some institutions don't need one or more of the help links that Canvas displays in the Help menu by default (e.g. institutions with their own help desk may want to remove the "Report a Problem" link and add their own). Use any one of the CSS rules in this file to hide the indicated help link.

**Note**: As with any part of Canvas, the links that these CSS rules target could change at any time. Be sure to check your beta environment before each production release to be sure that none of your CSS has broken due to an upcoming code change.
