Customizing LTI Integrations with JavaScript and CSS
======

By default, LTI-integrated learning tools will be opened in an
iFrame inside of the Canvas environment. This is preferred, as
the learner will not need to leave Canvas (the learning tool)
to engage with the external tool. It also gives a sense of
unity between Canvas and the external tool.

These benefits aside, this approach is not always the best. The
"lti_integration.js" JavaScript file in this folder can be used
to force LTI-integrated tools, as linked to in the "Modules"
view, to open in a new window or tab.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
