Customizing the Top Menu with JavaScript 
======

The script customize_menu.js demonstrates how a custom link can be added to the
top Canvas Navigation.  In this example, the link added is 

`<a href='https://support.myschool.edu'>Local Support</a>`

and is put just before the regular Canvas Help Button.  The text of the Canvas
help button is also changed from "Help" to "Canvas Help".


Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
