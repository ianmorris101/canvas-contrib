/**
 * JQuery is the javascript library used in many places across canvas.  
 *
 * This script describes how you would add a link to the top Canvas Navigation.
 * In this example, the link added is 
 * <a href='https://support.myschool.edu'>Local Support</a>
 *
 * and is put just before the regular Canvas Help Button.  This example also
 * renames the canvas help button from "Help" to "Canvas Help"
